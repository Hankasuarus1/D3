# CMPM 121 D3 Project

📝 Project Summary — D3.a

This milestone delivers the core mechanics of World of Bits, a map-based crafting game played on a grid of latitude–longitude cells. Using Leaflet, the game displays a fully visible grid centered on the classroom, with each cell showing whether it holds a token. Token generation is deterministic, ensuring a consistent world across page loads.

Players can interact only with nearby cells, pick up and hold a single token, drop tokens into empty cells, and merge equal-valued tokens to create higher-value ones. A simple UI shows the player’s current inventory and provides action feedback. The milestone is complete when the player successfully crafts a token that meets the target value.
